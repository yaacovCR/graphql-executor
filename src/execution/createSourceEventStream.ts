/**
 * Implements the "CreateSourceEventStream" algorithm described in the
 * GraphQL specification, resolving the subscription source event stream.
 *
 * Returns a Promise which resolves to either an AsyncIterable (if successful)
 * or an ExecutionResult (error). The promise will be rejected if the schema or
 * other arguments to this function are invalid, or if the resolved event stream
 * is not an async iterable.
 *
 * If the client-provided arguments to this function do not result in a
 * compliant subscription, a GraphQL Response (ExecutionResult) with
 * descriptive errors and no data will be returned.
 *
 * If the the source stream could not be created due to faulty subscription
 * resolver logic or underlying systems, the promise will resolve to a single
 * ExecutionResult containing `errors` and no `data`.
 *
 * If the operation succeeded, the promise resolves to the AsyncIterable for the
 * event stream returned by the resolver.
 *
 * A Source Event Stream represents a sequence of events, each of which triggers
 * a GraphQL execution for that event.
 *
 * This may be useful when hosting the stateful subscription service in a
 * different process or machine than the stateless GraphQL execution engine,
 * or otherwise separating these two steps. For more on this, see the
 * "Supporting Subscriptions at Scale" information in the GraphQL specification.
